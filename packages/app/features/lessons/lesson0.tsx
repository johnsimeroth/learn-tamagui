        <SizableText>
          Alright, let's jump in! Navigate to the folder you want to house your tamagui project in.
          Then run
        </SizableText>
        <Pre>{`npm create tamagui@latest`}</Pre>
        <MultiLine>
          {`Select Next/Expo/Solito for the project template. Follow any other command prompts. This may take a few minutes to run while it sets up a functioning project. Once complete, \`cd\` into the directory that was created by the install command. e.g. \`cd myTamaguiApp\`.
        Run 'yarn' to install dependencies.
        Run \`yarn web\` and navigate to the localhost port listed in the terminal output to see the project on web.
        Run \`yarn native\` in *a separate terminal* and follow command line prompts to see the project in expo.
        Both of these commands result in dev builds that are faster to build and enable hot reloads, but don't get optimized by the tamagui compiler. We'll get to that later. Now that you've got a working project, let's take a look at the repo structure.`}

        <H2>Folder Layout</H2>
        <SizableText>
          At the top level, you've got several folders and a little under a billion config files
          (hooray, we love javascript!). I want you to focus on just two folders at this level for
          now: `packages/` and `apps/`. The `packages` folder is for code that's shared between both
          web and native, while the `apps/` folder is for platform specific code.
        </SizableText>
        <H3>packages/</H3>
        <SizableText>
          You'll spend most of your time in the pacakges directory. Inside packages you have
          `packages/app` and `packages/ui`. `packages/app` should contain all of your app's business
          logic, organized by feature. `packages/ui`, on the other hand, is where very
          low-level/basic reusable UI components go to get optimized by the compiler. If you're
          unsure where a component should go, the rule of thumb is: if you're using `styled()`, it
          goes in `packages/ui`, if you're not using styled and instead you're making a more complex
          stateful component (e.g. a home feed, a nav bar, etc) it goes in `packages/app`. Where
          would you put it in `packages/app`? Let's cover that when it comes up as we start adding
          features, so we can keep this high level for now.
        </SizableText>
        <H3>apps/</H3>
        <MultiLine>
          {`The \`apps/\` directory, as mentioned above, is for platform specific code. So if you expand it you'll see an \`apps/expo\` folder, and an \`apps/next\` folder. You'll usually only need to interact with these folders for a few reasons. Some (but not all) example reasons are listed below:
        1. Adding navigation between screens in your app, which should always be platform-specific.
        2. Installing native-specific dependencies (which you'll do in the expo folder).
        3. Adjusting platform-specific configuration files (e.g. adding or configuring next plugins).
        There are other cases, but hopefully the pattern is somewhat clear based on these three.`}

          Now refresh your web page and confirm that you're seeing the programmer's greeting. Do the
          same on your expo app. Once that's working, treat yourself to a git commit and head to the
          next lesson, or the optional (but highly recommended) cleanup section below!

        <H2>Clean Up (optional)</H2>
        <SizableText>
          Since we've been chatting about folder structure, let's remove some files and folders that
          we won't be using to help make things a little easier to understand and navigate. You
          don't have to do this if you don't want to, but it will make your code a lot cleaner and
          prevent errors related to stuff you're not actually working on. If deleting stuff makes
          you feel anxious, just make a commit before you proceed so that you can always return to
          this point and see how the starter repo handles toast or solito slugs, for example. For
          our project, you can safely delete:
        </SizableText>
        <Pre>{deleteList}</Pre>
        <MultiLine>
          {`Now when you try to run the app, it will fail (because there are references in the code to those files and directories) so use your debugging skills to locate all of those references and remove them. While you're at it, if you're using a syntax highlighting feature that shows when imports and other variables go unusued, clear those out too. Once the app is rendering without errors again on both web and mobile, you're ready to commit changes and proceed!`}

          I can't stress enough that this tutorial is just a walkthrough on how to use amazing tools
          that other much smarter people than me have built. Those smart people have also written
          extensive documentation on these tools, and know them far better than I do. So if at any
          point you feel stuck or like my instructions are unclear, these are the places you should
          look for more detailed docs or community input:
