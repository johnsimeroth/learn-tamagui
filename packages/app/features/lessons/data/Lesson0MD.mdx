You're on lesson 0: setup. By the end of this lesson you should:
1. Have a working web app that renders hello world,
2. Understand the high level folder structure of a tamagui/solito/expo monorepo, and
3. Know where to look for more information and details.

Let's jump right in

```tsx
console.log('hello world');
```
