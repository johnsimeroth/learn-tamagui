# Lesson 0

You're on lesson 0: setup. By the end of this lesson you should:
1. Have a working web app that renders hello world,
2. Understand the high level folder structure of a tamagui/solito/expo monorepo, and
3. Know where to look for more information and details.

## Fine Print
Before we get to the steps below, some caveats:
1. This guide assumes you're familiar with Typescript, React, and React Native.
2. This guide assumes you have node, expo, yarn, git, and possibly other tools that I take for granted already installed.

## Install
Alright, let's jump in! Navigate to the folder you want to house your tamagui project in. Then run
```bash
npm create tamagui@latest
```
Select Next/Expo/Solito for the project template. Follow any other command prompts. This may take a few minutes to run while it sets up a functioning project. Once complete, `cd` into the directory that was created by the install command. e.g. `cd myTamaguiApp`.

Run 'yarn' to install dependencies.
Run `yarn web` and navigate to the localhost port listed in the terminal output to see the project on web.
Run `yarn native` in *a separate terminal* and follow command line prompts to see the project in expo.

Both of these commands result in dev builds that are faster to build and enable hot reloads, but don't get optimized by the tamagui compiler. We'll get to that later.

Now that you've got a working project, let's take a look at the repo structure.

## Folder Layout
At the top level, you've got several folders and a little under a billion config files (hooray, we love javascript!). I want you to focus on just two folders at this level for now: `packages/` and `apps/`. The `packages` folder is where everything that's shared between components goes

## Clean Up
Let's remove some files and folders that we won't be using. If deleting stuff makes you feel anxious, just make a commit before you proceed so that you can always return to this point and see how the starter repo handles toast or solito slugs.



```tsx
console.log('hello world');
```
